",while you were in egypt i'm assuming that's when you heard about omicron and this variant that was starting to spread yes so it was actually the day before we were to depart to come back to canada that we all got an email from there that canceled our flight because they were no longer allowed to fly into canada at that point we had to scramble to find another flight to get home to toronto we managed like almost right away to get a flight from cairo to vienna and then vienna to toronto so we all felt great we felt relieved we had our kova test in egypt and we got to the airport to check in and basically when we got to austrian airlines they they laughed they said you're going to canada no you're not because canada is not accepting the egyptian negative test so at that point they were very helpful trying to get us home as quickly as possible we ended up flying to from cairo to vienna vienna to frankfurt and then had a clover test in frankfurt had to wait in the airport for three hours to get all of us there were six of us traveling together a negative culvert test in in frankfurt and so through every step kathy were you checking in to make sure that you were doing everything that the canadian government required of you as a canadian citizen yes we were maggie we filled we all filled out our arrive can apps we all received a qr code that they had accepted our quarantine plan so you arrive back home you're happy to be on canadian soil and things kind of go awry what happened next as once you arrived well we knew that there was going to be you know and we understand that there has to be some kind of safeguards put in place but um as soon as they knew that we came from egypt going through customs they pulled us over to the canadian border services and basically she told us that we were not going home that and that night she basically read us our rights at the end basically saying if you do not comply you will be subject to you you're being detained by the i forget if she said the canadian government or by canada border services but you're being detained and if you don't comply you're subject to a 750 up to a 750 000 fine or six months in prison so you know it puts a little fear in you too right yeah they put us in another queue where we had to like fill out so many more forms everything get our kova test go to it once another checkpoint where they gave us a home test kit and then they put us in line waiting for the bus to the hotel so we waited at the airport for three hours for the bus to come it was a big school bus there was shuttles apparently before that then we got to the hotel there was three shuttle buses in front of us waiting to be checked into the hotel we waited on the bus another two hours no water no bathroom breaks nothing when we did get our turn to go in there was only two people checking in all these many many people and then on top of on top of that a number of you were out of your medication so there's a medical aspect to this as well the nurses that we saw the first morning when we woke up a nurse came to the door all the big hazmat suit was so surreal and you know took our temperature which we were all normal and then the second morning is when you know a nurse came we knew we were negative and i said look i'm out of my anxiety medication i really need to be released very soon and she just said i'll send someone up my girlfriend across the hall i heard her say you know if i don't have my medication i could go into a diabetic coma i'll send someone up nobody came up you took your test negative again and you actually with a group of your friends decided that you were going to leave tell me how that all unfolded what the process was supposed to be once you get those results you would be assigned a quarantine officer and they would come and do the release and find out what the rest of your quarantine plan was so just because you know you've got a lot of time on your hands we were trying to phone the red cross who was our point of contact but they weren't answering and then in the morning we did eight when there was too open we started calling and calling never getting an answer we're still trying to follow the process as well well one of my friends did get through to someone and the way four of us our rooms were facing each other across the hall so we would always have these meetings from our doorway so my friend was with her the speaker phone and this it maggie it was excruciating we explained the situation she asked us all her names she couldn't find two of the girls names or their files she found my name and another name several times she asked us to spell her name it was excruciatingly painful finally she said i'm gonna our supervisor is here i'm gonna send her out well nobody came up wow nobody came up so at that point we said look we could be here we don't know how long we're going to be here one of the girls so we decided we're going to leave um we got all packed up and one of the girls said you know what i'm going to stay just till noon i'm really trying to follow this process you know and that they're you know the finest hanging over our head etc aside from all the other money that we spent now to get home so we were very nervous going down in the elevator because we knew we were going to get pushed back from that little point coming in maggie we went there was not a soul sitting in that place we walked right out we knew from the girl that had left earlier that so no security there sorry cathy so no security guard or anything kind of manning making sure wow nothing so we get to the end of the driveway there's a security car there she jumps out what room numbers are you from we tell her our room numbers and then it was almost like a comedy show five of them came running down because they knew that you know they weren't there to escort a property and kind of we all were upset at this point there was things being said you know like i said look i'm going to have a panic attack my friend here has not had her medication and she the girl just said just get off our property and you're subject to a six thousand dollar fine and we think that gladly the girl that weighed it till noon she stayed on hold with the red cross till noon never getting an answer she then called down to security to say i need a nurse to come up here to release me and they said the nurses don't have the authority to release you she goes well then i need the quarantine officer to come out and release me she's whoever said there's no quarantine officer on site today she goes when will when will there be she said there won't be one today what i what i heard you say to kathy is that you knew that there would be a process when you got home you knew that obviously you know you'd have to adhere to certain restrictions protocol and all those things absolutely what it sound but what it sounds like is that the government was not prepared for this onslaught and how to deal with this situation properly if the government sees this kathy what would be your message to them because i i think you're right there are hundreds and hundreds of people who are probably in a very similar position than that you and your friends were in kathy what's the message to them i think there's been time it's been two years to have these kind of protocols in place and to streamline them why could i get a negative covet test in egypt in 24 hours and in frankfurt in three hours and then come to my home country and be told it could take up to 72 hours it's especially when you have a quarantine plan in pit in place i didn't have to pay to stay there but the taxpayers paid for all that and i think it was wasteful because if it was more streamlined we could have been processed out of there,False,en,True

",china doesn't operate like your country the chinese government is a face and greed driven government that relies on lies and bullying to maintain leadership in as much as my life is at risk because already i have had or i have received a lot of personal attacks based on the kind of videos i do mind you i am only here to speak the truth the chinese government really needs to do a better job of hiding information if they're going to keep changing their story and blaming the coronavirus on other countries like italy or the usa or japan or whatever while i'm not a fan of theories or unproven scenarios it's been impossible to avoid them in the outbreak of the coronavirus simply due to the fact that it was completely covered up in the beginning stages in china this isn't really going to be a theory it's just public information i found [Music] in the past few years i still do not understand and believe why the whole world is in a pandemic i have been searching and researching so hard and this is what i found first and foremost this is the communist party of china's fault and the fact that there are people gasping for breath in their deathbed in your town is solely on the consciences of the ccp and the people who entrusted them to enter our global systems like the who based on my numerous research and here is what i found out so in november 18th 2019 we already know that coronavirus pandemic became a thing around december 2019 that was actually the first time i heard about the virus and at that time i was living in beijing china and in november 18 2019 there was a job posting hiring lab technicians to study the relationship between bats and the sars virus such as karuna virus then another job posting followed the previous post and this is where it got big so when i examined the job posting i noticed that there was actually a follow-up job posting on december 24th of 2019 remember this is before any news broke which basically says we've discovered a new and terrible virus and would like to recruit people to come deal with it why was china or this particular lab hiring or why was there an available position for lab technicians to study the relationship between bats and the corona virus also there is a lab technician who goes by the name xi jian li who was the lead researcher of this lab this woman was nicknamed the bat woman as around 2017 between 2017 and 2018 she was called the bad woman in china why was she called a bad woman she was called a bad woman because she was always stating the relationship between bats and the virus called coronavirus turns out this woman xi jiang li she was the lead researcher of the lab and she was famous for bat studies they called her bat woman in some circles she even received an award for proving bats are natural reservoirs of sars like coronaviruses in november 2017 all the way through 2018 she had already written three articles about how bats can transmit coronaviruses to humans note she even received an award for proving that bats are naturally reservoirs for sas virus like coronavirus and she wrote an article about this in november 2017 to 2018. this is all public knowledge she and her team went south to yunnan province all the way you know deep south of china is very beautiful there and she found out that sars like viruses originally came from bats in fact in 2017 from data taken from one of her studies in rural yanan province she took blood samples from 218 villagers after testing it it showed that sars-like viruses found in bats from nearby caves have a high potential to affect people she predicted that humans coming into contact with bats would have a high chance of becoming infected after blood testing the 218 villagers she found that six people in yunnan were found to be infected already we know what happened to doctors and lab technicians who tried to draw attention to the coronavirus pandemic early december or late november in 2019 that alone justifies a lot now let's talk about how exactly the virus spread xiaobo tao he was a professor he posted a thesis about details that he knew about but he wasn't supposed to talk about i see some kind of links to people like li wen liang who wanted to say something but they couldn't but xiaobo tao the professor he posted the information anyway he knew researchers at the lab that were infected and they had already begun self quarantine after they showed symptoms of being infected and the majority of the researchers at the lab were already suspicious that this virus that they were coming down with was from bats the professor directly pointed out that the main source of the virus is from the wuhan lab which is only 300 or actually 280 meters to be exact from the juanan seafood market where it was originally claimed to have originated now here is another thing that also triggered my attention while the virus was spreading the chinese local government stopped people from traveling from cities and provinces within china so nobody could travel from beijing to shanghai from shanghai to beijing from beijing to guangzhou from wuhan whatever everybody was stopped and denied travel assets in within china but people were forced to leave china including africans who lived in china at that time a lot of africans were through out of their house were accused of bringing the virus into china and went through out of the country a lot of foreigners were also force to leave the country now what does this tell you now the chinese local government is stopping people from traveling in within china but is forcing foreigners to leave the country with the virus to their countries to spread [Music] [Music] just like i said i don't care how this video ends or who gets to see this video as usual youtube has also demonetized this video but i do not care as much as my message is reaching the masses i am pleased hi ladies and gentlemen my name is jeffrey and i'm only here to inform you if you did enjoy this video do want to subscribe like write a comment let me know what you think about the coronavirus pandemic until then it is your boy jeffrey sweet and i'm out thank

",so as more omicron cases are confirmed in canada officials are utilizing the precautionary principle better to keep people in quarantine now as information about the new variant comes in but what's really going on inside these quarantine hotels travelers returning from banned countries are claiming they're being neglected some are saying we're under fed we're being mistreated tiffany tiffany gora is a canadian who's under mandatory travel quarantine after returning from cairo egypt with her five-year-old and her eight-year-old and her husband canadians who work in egypt egypt of course one of the additional countries canada added to the list of countries from which foreign travel is banned so she just got out of a quarantine facility after almost four days ago i think you just got out a few hours ago tiffany and good to talk to you again i spoke to you earlier today um what was it like for you and your your family inside this quarantine hotel can you can you describe what you went through thanks evan um yeah absolutely i mean it was an extremely difficult and you know onerous and traumatic process for for myself and our two daughters my husband hasn't traveled back with us um as yet tbd if he decides to follow um but i mean it's extremely it's grueling it's it's isolated you know you you don't have fresh air you can't exercise you can't leave uh you know the food is is atrocious and it's not nutritious and you know there's just it's it's absolutely you know mind-boggling that you could hold healthy law-abiding fully vaccinated citizens in these kinds of conditions uh you know we we had two negative pcr tests before getting on the plane to to come to canada and then we waited you know three days to have to have a third canadian pcr which resulted also negative um you know while we were waiting in the hotel so you so you get your pcr test in egypt and then you get another one where you you stop over in frankfurt you pay for all these tests yourself how much were they uh i mean pcr tests in egypt are about a hundred dollars a person so that's three hundred dollars and uh we needed um quick turnaround in frankfurt so we had uh one and a half hour tests which are about 179 euros a piece so it's it's an extremely large expense for a family for sure so the government didn't cover those i'd we'd heard that they would be covered but those aren't covered then you get to calgary you get to this quarantine hotel how long were you stuck in this now a lot of people say okay well you're traveling and this is the band and wait people get it but you know you had these two kids like how long were you basically stuck in your room with your two kids so we arrived saturday uh and went through the whole process uh you know at arrival and and all of the testing and things like that and then we left today which is tuesday in the afternoon our test came back uh very early this morning so it took you know three days to get our test back you're double vaccinated you had your pcr test on you wrote on facebook the food's horrible it arrives cold it has limited nutritional value no fruit and vegetables outside of potatoes uh you basically got tap water and a little coffee for the kids kids are going stew crazy you wrote no fresh air no physical activities we're doing yoga and school work i bought a few card games but only to not you can fill so many hours like just get if you were to describe what to the federal government who's saying you know you've got to go through this what was it like for your family i mean it's uh it's difficult for a family it's it's it's difficult for travelers i mean mentally physically you know you you come off a long flight in our case we flew for 30 hours and then you know you go back into these kinds of situations like i said you know we're we're law abiding citizens we've quarantined at our home numerous times in the past you know we understand what the government is trying is trying to do i don't necessarily agree with the xenophobic approach that they've taken to targeting these 10 countries i think in in 2021 almost 2022 is it's it's crazy to think that any variant of covid comes from a single a single country or a single source you know be it one or be at 10 you know we live in a global reality uh you know i think these targeted measures are unnecessary and i think they'll in the end be be ineffective um it just seems it seems like it was you know poorly thought out and and ill-designed and a knee-jerk reaction uh to try to stem some of the you know some of the the panic over over this variant uh this isn't the first variant it's it's the ninth variant of you know of interest it's uh you know how many times are we going to go through this and to try you know to strand travelers overnight i mean i'm you know i'm an expatriate i live abroad i'm well educated i'm i'm nimble i'm fairly young that's not the case there are elderly travelers in the airport who came off of nile cruises and they don't have wi-fi connectivity and it is these are things that are difficult for people to manage when the rules change overnight and and they've done everything they can do up to that point to you know to to do the best they can to make it right and follow the rules yeah i couldn't even reach you we couldn't even call tiffany gora directly uh we had to go through the red cross and i had to call her just quite something okay tiffany gore i really appreciate it first of all i'm glad you're out and you're healthy and you're safe your kids are safe thank you so much i appreciate

",genetic sequencing needs to take place in order for us to find out whether you are that that covid19 you have identifies a specific variant um you know and so one thing that we are doing at austin public health along with our hospitals and clinical providers and testing laboratories as we are trying to work with them so that we have a better idea um what what variants are actually circulating in our community and that's one of the main purposes of genetic sequencing and and variant surveillance is to make sure we know uh what what's occurring in our community and so like dr walks mentioned you know 98 of what we have is delta those genetic sequencing tests are things that typically help us identify what's circulating so how it works in our area if you get tested a pcr test and those are reported to austin public health we have relationships with hospitals like i said providers and some testing facilities and we try to make arrangements so that those tests if there's enough viable material can be sent on to the state lab for further analysis and so a lot of times uh you know it is kind of challenging to get genetic sequencing completed uh but you know it's sort of it's sort of a random sample of what's actually circulating out there um and um anyhow it does take time it takes extra effort to try to do that so um as you can see with what's happened over the last two weeks in the united states you know omicron hit and then we a lot of people started looking actively looking for that uh variance sequencing um but all in all just the bottom line of it regardless of what the variant is prevention methods that we take place and use every day and the recommendations that we make to you every day still are the same and still will help you prevent getting disease and that is wearing your mask washing your hands getting vaccinated if you're sick stay at home go ahead and get your booster vaccination or if you haven't got vaccinated get vaccinated and if you do become ill consider giving a test there's multiple options for getting a test there's testing that's available through austin public health but you can also get tested through your provider and there are plenty of over-the-counter tests that are also available so with that i will stop and turn it over to cassie de leon and uh it's all yours cassie thanks janet um and just as everyone else has said on the panel i couldn't echo more about the things that we can do and have been doing to protect ourselves from the spread of coven 19 and protect our loved ones this time last year we were waiting for the vaccine to arrive and now we've had a full year of its availability and we've been implementing it and i really want to um congratulate and thank our community for stepping up and doing what they needed to do to protect themselves for standing for going to those vaccine clinics and getting the vaccine right now even with the newly eligible population of pediatrics 5 to 11 we are at 69.13 uh percent fully vaccinated that's incredible um that's that's better than most of the state of texas so that's a lot to to really think about as a as a city in a community that we've really hit those really important milestones additionally with the um new pediatric um five to eleven year olds uh we're making great progress there we have seen that um 27 of that population living that's eligible uh living in uh travis county has gotten the first dose and we know now that about half of them have been fully uh vaccinated so that's incredible and knowing that that's only been that vaccine's only been available for about six weeks or a little less than six weeks and then in addition to think ahead to boosters there's been a lot of demand lately for boosters which is fantastic and it's great to see people out in the community looking wanting to get that vaccine and it's showing in our data uh we have seen that um 24 of our fully vaccinated population has received an additional dose which is incredible and so that means that people are actively getting vaccinated we have that uh 200 000 people who have received that additional dose and that means that we're just that much more protected that being said uh there are a lot of options for boosters but if you have don't have an appointment you can come to austin public health walk up and get a vaccine and if you haven't gotten vaccinated at all this is an important time to do it and you can think of it as a way to give a special gift to the community to your family to your loved ones here at the holiday season this is the season of giving and this is opportunity to give each other good health so as you're thinking about your holiday plans consider that as part of your planning consider the potential of future years that you'd be extending for everyone if we can get um ahead of this next surge and with that i'll open this up for questions we do have beth sullivan on the line from the austin chronicle to ask questions on behalf of the media beth good morning everyone and thank you for being here with us today the first question is from community impact with the fda authorizing the pfizer booster for the 16 to 17 age range how important is it that 16 and 17 year olds receive an additional shot it's important that everybody who's eligible for booster therapy go out and get their booster shot we are dealing right now predominantly with the delta variant in our community and it does cause severe disease and illness and boosters will give you that extra protection against delta and the new omnicron variant that we're looking at um on our shores now so it's extremely important for everyone that's eligible to go and get that booster shot and i'd like to add in that austin public health um thanks to dr walks rapidly um preparing us we now have the ability to provide that booster shot as well and so if you are looking uh to getting your um 16 year old uh boosted and 17 year olds boosted you can definitely come to any one of the austin public health locations and receive that booster dose the next question is from cbs austin aph reported an increase of people getting booster shots last week is that continuing what percentage of vaccines being given are booster shots we definitely have seen an increase in uh booster demand i was looking at numbers and it really does vary from clinic to clinic but it's ranging from about 75 percent to 90 percent of the vaccine administered at uh our our normal clinics um our booster doses uh so it's exciting to see that um i'm really proud of our team because we planned for this and we were able to expand operations and incorporate uh what we needed to make sure that we were able to serve everyone that came in and so we are seeing actually this week the same demands um and we've been able to also as the demand had increased each operation each location has made operational changes to help um really make the clinic move uh smoother and run smoother to make sure that we're providing the best service possible that being said as we know with increased demand and allowing for a walk-up space there may be some wait times but we're also trying to manage that as much as possible there are opportunities to make appointments and so if you make an appointment um you would be able to fast-track through the the clinic but also we are also looking to see how we can problem solve for walk up so that there is an enjoyable pleasurable experience but note it's important to plan um you may have to to wait a little bit if you come out to one of our clinics but you'll get that shot today and i'd like to also add um just from my observation at the clinics if you do decide to present to one of our clinics uh in a walk-up fashion one thing that will put you at an advantage uh and will help exit expedite some of the process is making sure that you register your aph vaccine portal to make sure they have your information in there especially if you if you received your first or second dose from a commercial pharmacy or from your from another provider if you haven't if you did receive it from aph we will have your information and we will not have to put that in but that will will uh speed up the process a little bit kut asks with the rise in demand for boosters what specific steps if any is aph taking to address long wait times at waka vaccination clinics yes just as we kind of already um mentioned before we're doing quite a bit to try to push in additional staff to help support what we can and we also based on kind of what we've seen last week we've made some staffing adjustments to increase vaccinators and other staffing needs where there are some areas in the clinic that may cause additional waves that being said as janet said one of the things that individuals can do is to make sure they're registered if there's an appointment available make an appointment because that will increase that will speed up your process uh through the clinic we're doing everything we can to make the experience as pleasurable as possible but note with a walk-up clinic capacity if you're in line at 5 30 and so are a hundred of your friends um it's going to take time to get you through but know that we will get you through and you'll get that vaccine um and at any place that you are looking to get um any kind of service if you're trying to get that last minute uh christmas gift uh you may experience a long wait time just to get through the checkout that's the same situation we've got a lot of people looking for the service um across the city and we want to make sure that people can have access so it's time to have some patience we have we really are working with our clinic staff to make sure that they have patience as well and so that we can get everyone served and everyone have as pleasant experience as possible the next question is from here at the austin chronicle how important is it that people get a booster shot now rather than waiting for a potential omicron specific booster all right i'll uh answer that um this vaccine is has been shown to be effective at protecting people from severe disease illness and hospitalizations and death for the delta variant which is the predominant variant in our community now and its early indications are that it is also going to be protective against this new variant omicron the importance of booster right now is that it will help improve that protection and so it is important for us to use the vaccine that we have available now to protect us now as we prepare for possible surge in cases and to continue to get that extra layer of protection and wear your mask additionally as you're traveling to visit friends and loved ones this holiday season it's important that you test before you go to make sure that you're not ill and that you're not spreading virus and if you are ill if you are positive in your covenant 19 test it's important that you isolate contact your health provider and see if you're eligible for treatment or monoclonal antibody treatment the next question is from kxan experts are saying the omicron variant is spreading faster in the uk than in south africa what implications does that have for us here at home um i'll go ahead and take that um so as i've said through various other press conferences that we've had um you know we always look to what's happening in the european union just as because it tends to be a precursor of what can happen here in the united states um you know with cases rapidly exponentially growing in the uk uh we have we have concern that that will happen here in the united states as well so we need to do all those things that we're talking about getting boosted getting your first or second dose on board so that you can keep we can keep this variant at bay and you know the other measures that we talk about uh wearing a mask social distancing you really just need to be at this point very aware of your surroundings especially if you're outside of your home or you have people coming into your home um you know for the holidays just make sure that you're protecting yourself and your loved ones uh to the best of your ability so that you don't you don't see that rapid spread here but but it is uh based on preliminary data is definitely much more transmissible uh you know obviously there's still a lot of research that's taking place to determine whether or not omicron is as severe as delta but um we we want to make sure that we protect place ourselves in the best defensive position right now and it's to do those preventative measures and i'd just like to add on that this virus has spread exponentially in south africa it's doing the same in the uk and we're likely to see the same thing locally we reduce spread by masking indoors in particular because ventilation is not as good so any chance that you can take to meet in groups outdoors is very beneficial for decreasing spread testing before you go to make sure that you're not ill before you go to visit friends and family will be essential and most important of all is that you must get your booster if you're eligible and get vaccinated if you've not received any vaccine i can't stress enough that this is the time when we're out in public places getting ready for the holidays you're going to be indoors shopping and gathering what you need to make those those dinner parties and parties happen it is extremely important even if you've been vaccinated to wear a mask we do know that there's asymptomatic transmission of this virus to those who are vaccinated particularly those that have not had their booster so it's important that you protect yourself and mask when you are indoors in public places this question is from kop radio what preparations is aph making to hospitalize and ventilate central texans once the omicron variant arrives in this area is there any special instruction media organizations should be giving to community members besides get vaccinated get boosted and mask it's important for us to do all those mitigation things that we've talked about masking social distancing washing hands and really getting your vaccination in a booster if you're eligible but in addition to that on the 6th of december the cdc updated their guidance on testing self-testing and they've recommended that if you're going to be traveling this holiday season to test yourself before you go to make sure that you're not sick um and so that's something that we need to put on that checklist of planning when we're getting ready to go and see our family and friends this holiday and and it's also important to test when you return to make sure that you didn't you weren't exposed while you were out and visiting so the big take-home message is now is not the time to to take anything off the table now is the time to wear a mask indoors in public places now is the time to get vaccinated if you've not been vaccinated and now is the time to get your booster shot if you're 16 years or older so that we can enjoy the holidays and hopefully prevent a surge in cases and i'll add also um you know one thing that especially with coronavirus what we've seen as we investigate these cases is that one a lot of people may have very mild symptoms and they they may think it's nothing but you know what it ends up being something ends up being coronavirus and uh then it then it ends up being some kind of super spreader event where we were you know investigating the outbreak or a cluster of illnesses illness within a social setting so you know i would stress in addition to all these other things if you even have the slightest symptoms uh you need to you need to stay home if you're not feeling well you may not have fever but you may have a scratchy throat you may have sniffles um and those could be indications that you have covered so if you are experiencing symptoms of covariate or cold and flu or respiratory type symptoms you need to make sure that you stay home and isolate yourself so that you don't spread disease elsewhere and again like we you heard the term and no one said it in a long time flatten the curve we need to flatten the curve here we need to make sure that we stop the disease transmission cycle and that is the way to do that is by doing all these things that we've been talking about the next question is from univision 62. last year many people couldn't or didn't want to travel because they weren't vaccinated for the holidays would you recommend people to travel this year what are the recommendations it's important that you test before you travel and test when you return from travel regardless of your vaccinations status if you are sick as janet just said it's important that you stay home and not go and spread your respiratory illness to someone else it's important that you mask in indoor public spaces where you are not familiar with whether people are vaccinated around you or if they're ill if you're going to go and visit somebody who is at risk for severe disease from covet 19 you should make sure that you're vaccinated fully and boosted if you're eligible for a booster and protect them um this is the time when we're sharing our love with our loved ones and as cassie said earlier the greatest gift that we can give each other is that protection of our health and their health um we we're choosing life in this season we're choosing to share the love that we have for each other in this season and it's really important for us to take those steps that we know work to make that possible to make that joy possible the next question is from community impact as the emergence of the omicron variant yielded an increase in people receiving their first doses we have seen it has been a little interesting um that there with every clinic we have we do see a trickle of first doses um we would like to see more but we also have a very high vaccination rate um and there's a lot of uh reasons why uh those uh first doses we actually talked with some i had an opportunity to talk to some of them so some of the anecdotes that we've heard in the field are these are individuals who suffered in the delta variant and had infusion and as a result antibody infusion has to wait 90 days and so right now hitting that 90 day mark so they can get there and they were unvaccinated so now they're choosing to get vaccinated because of the disease they suffered during delta other um information i've heard is that um some vaccine mandates were coming through um depending on their employer or whatnot and so they were needing to get vaccinated because of that and then omnicron omicron has also been um a motivator for some folks to get vaccinated but that's um it's a very very small percentage that we're seeing um with first dose uptake outside of that five to 11 year old population we still do want to encourage that everyone who's five years old and older can be vaccinated for coven 19. and so if you are in that category and you have not received your vaccine or you still have not completed your vaccine series we want to encourage that you get vaccinated so that's that's really important right now um literally that's most of our population is eligible so we want to see those um extend and continue to increase and then if you are eligible for booster one more time it's time to get boosted if you um had a booster in july um you should be looking at your car to see if it's time to get boosted so we want to encourage that and if you received a johnson johnson vaccine anyone who received a johnston-johnson vaccine needs to get a second dose two months after their initial dose the next question is from cbs austin now that we're two weeks out from thanksgiving what does it look like the impact has been from that holiday on new cases we are seeing an increase in the number of cases that we're um receiving um we've been seeing some increase in our school cases after those indoor gatherings with families at the thanksgiving holiday time and um i'll let janet go on to give you some more details on what their case investigation team's been saying yeah so i did ask the case investigators this specific question this morning and again i i wanted to know were there clusters associated with family gatherings and such and while i think most people were very careful uh the biggest trend as far as cases go have been associated with increased travel so people who've actually traveled to other areas where they have a higher transmission rate of covid and come back to austin are those that are getting uh that are becoming ill and being exposed to coven so i think this is why it's all the more important uh to you know implement the cdc guidance and those things that dr walks has talked about today about testing before you go somewhere and testing when you return and if you if you are ill or if you encounter someone who is coping positive you need to make sure that you're quarantining and isolating uh correctly um so so yeah travel and we will see a much greater travel uh i think this holiday season which is great for people to see their family and loved ones just make sure that you're doing everything you can to protect yourself enrich so that you can have a safe holiday with your family and friends but it's been mainly a lot of it has been related to travel exposure the next question is from kut what efforts are being made to vaccinate communities with low vaccination rates with their first dose how many people are getting vaccinated per week through those methods so i'll uh jump in and answer that um we do a lot of direct outreach into areas and zip codes we know have low vaccine uptake we do on the ground outreach we work with trusted community sources that the community is familiar with and we try to be in spaces and places that the community trusts and are comfortable in so that um we can be easily accessible we also work with our um health equity line to directly call out to folks who may need either a booster that's from that community and they've suffered higher rates of disease or also if we get information about groups that um are still seeking vaccine and have not been able to get a first dose they also have been really beneficial in pr and trying to reach out to them some of the um it's difficult for me to tease out the data specifically from those um those specific um zip codes uh we do know from the zip codes how much vaccine uptake we have but i'd have to go back and look a little deeper to pull out the first dose uptake but i think what's also important is we look at all of them our goal is to get them up to 70 and um right now we have a few that are under that 60 percent and even one that's under 50 and so we we really are focused in targeting in those areas to make sure that um anyone who's seeking a vaccine has access um and uh and we're making ourselves available as much as possible and utilizing trusted sources through faith-based communities we're at churches um through businesses local businesses through affordable housing complexes so we try to be in every space we possibly can be where we know that people are experiencing barriers to access vaccine and also hosting educational sessions because sometimes it takes time for people to hear about the vaccine and to come to that decision because this decision is personal it's your health decision and we want to make sure that you have all the information that you need uh to make that decision for yourself and for your family the next question excuse me just want to jump on there real quick um to say specifically you know not only are we looking at geographic areas where we have low uptake we do know that in populations that are historically underserved or marginalized the rates are not where we would like them to be and so there is a full court press in our black and latinx communities to make sure that we are providing not only information and acts or access but resources and tools because we understand that aph might not be the place that a person chooses to to get their information from or even from their vaccine so our partnerships with community-based organizations and other faith groups as cassie mentioned are very important in these efforts the city made a significant investment in community health workers and we've been very intentional about recruiting uh people that are reflective of the communities that we are trying to serve and we are continuing to develop our language access programs to make sure that um language is not a barrier but not only are we giving a lot of information we've also been very intentional about having opportunities for communities to report back to us what didn't work you know what's what what is the reason why they're not seeking a vaccine in any way that we can influence those decisions or improve our processes or our partnerships to do that we've been very intentional about that thank you the next question is from kxan the biden administration recently announced take-home testing is going to be free for americans is that happening locally what does that mean for holiday testing and so part of our um pandemic response uh in partnership with the county and the office of homeland security and emergency management we have purchased test home test kits those are being distributed through the city of austin neighborhood service centers during the food pantry options uh travis county is also distributing those kits along with their food pantry efforts at the travis county community centers and as i mentioned earlier you know we we had an organization reach out to say that they were doing a very important outreach in the dell valley area and could do we have any test kits well we sure did and so again it's that kind of being able to provide the services ourselves working in collaboration with partners and also resourcing our community to make sure that those test kits are available and so not only are we making sure that the kits are available there's a full information sheet of what folks should do should they test positive we want them to call the nurse line you know we want them to report um to aph and then we want them to to stay home and isolate and make sure they contact their doctor because they could be eligible for monoclonal antibodies and we have seen that treatment work wonders in reducing the severity of disease and so we are full force with making sure that our community has access to those free resources this question is from kop radio are boosters the same as current first and as applicable in doses are all boosters for all three vaccines now available to those 16 and older and are the doses for available boosters the same for all age groups i'll i'll start um all three vaccines are available and they're available through austin public health the only vaccine that's available for those who are 18 and older is the pfizer vaccine and it's different for those who are 11 years old and older it's a different vaccine for your first and second dose than the other pfizer vaccine if you're 12 and older then the pfizer vaccine that's available for the 12 and older population is one vaccine the 5 to 11 vaccine is still a physical vaccine but it's a different dosing um scenario and it's a different um it's just it's just packaged a different way so it's important to note that it's important to be very upfront and honest when you're filling out your information it's hard for the individual at the at the vaccine center to know the difference between a 10 a 9 and a 12 year old so if your child is 12 you need to be getting the 12 year old an older vaccine if your child is 11 and under they need to be getting the younger version of the pfizer vaccine if you are um getting a mederna booster there's a difference in the modern booster if you are needing and you are immunocompromised it's important you talk about um your health situation so that you and the healthcare provider can make an informed decision about which dose additional dose do you need do you need the full third dose which is a full dose of moderna which is the same dosing that you got for your first and second dose or are you eligible to get just a normal booster and what the fda has recommended that's basically half the dose that you would have received from your first and second dose that's really important if you are immuno compromised in any way you really need to have a conversation because that decision is important to to make an impact on whether or not um your immunity and the protection that you need is going to be um provided through the type of dosing that we're able to provide so those conversations are really important i've had again some anecdotes from the field where individuals have said they'd come through the clinic they thought they were going to get the moderna booster and after they went through the process the decision was made and it's made with the patient and with the healthcare provider that they're more appropriate to get an additional dose based on their health conditions so those are things to make sure that you are aware of and that um when you go in to get your vaccine that you are informed about those things so that you can receive the best care possible and i'd just like to add that the new booster that's been approved for the 16 and 17 year olds is pfizer and just visor so if the booster for the 16 and 17 year olds is for pfizer product this is the final question and it's from univision 62. if people get the booster shot will it still be recommended to wear the mask please wear your mask a mask is an extra layer of protection and it's going to protect you from becoming sick with covet 19. if you happen to be someone who's an asymptomatic carrier of covet 19 you'll be protecting someone who you may come in contact with who is unvaccinated or at risk for um having coveted 19 sep a severe case covered 19 so i i it's an extra layer of protection many of us have purchased several different styles and colors to match outfits um i'm looking for somebody to come out with one that looks like a santa claus mask with a beard on it for the holiday season but it's really important it's an extra layer of protection as director stirrup said in one of our press conferences lightweight it's easy to to put one on and it's just going to help us decrease the spread of this disease in our community and so far with masking and the vaccine rates that we've had and now with the increase in boosters that we've been able to deploy we've been able to keep our case numbers down and it would be nice for all of us to have a holiday season where we're not seeing a surge in our hospitals and our health care workers would appreciate that too i'm just going to say it one more time because my mama told me if you heard something three times it must be true and so hopefully janet and cassie will help me out yes a mask will continue to be necessary please continue to wear your masks and i'll add for the third time yes masks will be necessary you need to break the goal here is to break the transmission cycle um not you know it's a life-saving tool that's at our disposal and um we need to do everything we can to break this transmission cycle and protect not only yourself but those around you especially with omicron on the horizon and we don't know the transmit i mean we know that it's it appears to be much more transmissible we need to do what we can to protect ourselves and masking is one of those options and i'll just layer on for that extra mass mask mask wash hands stay home if you're sick think about your family think about your friends because the best gift you can give is to not get them sick and vaccinate vaccinate vaccinate all right we're hearing you ladies loud and clear we want to thank dr aph interim director adrian sterp chief epidemiologist jana pachette chief administrative officer for disease prevention and health promotion cassandra de leon and to our pool reporter today beth sullivan from the austin chronicle thank you for joining us today have a safe weekend wear your mask get vaccinated [Music] gotta get it done [Music] now he won't think twice [Music] you,False,en,True
"mWWvwawXjso
",so hello good morning afternoon or good evening depending on where you're joining us from as usual we are coming to you from the african union headquarters and specifically from the offices of the africa centers for disease control and the prevention with another edition of our thursday morning briefings on the kovit 19 situation on the african continent as usual we'll start with the briefing from the director of the africa cdc dr john kangasang and then we'll move on to the question and answer section and when we get to that you can send in your questions to the what's up number plus 251 94 550 one zero let me give you that number again plus two five one nine four five five zero two three one zero alternatively you can ask your question live or utilize the question and answer section my name is wayne musabayana i'm head of communication at the african union commission and it is my pleasure to hand you over now to the director of the africa centers for disease control and the prevention dr john kennedy you have the floor thank you thank you so much wayne and good to see everybody on the platform as we do every thursday so as usual i'll do three things to give you an update on the epidemiological situation and then discuss issues related to testing and what africa cdc is currently doing to support member states and then conclude with the situation with vaccines so as as of today november food a total of uh 8.5 million cases of kobe 19 have been reported across all 55 member states of that number 218 000 deaths have been officially reported and that represents a case fatality ratio of a rate of 2.6 percent that number of deaths that is the 218 000 represents uh 4.4 of the overall debts reported globally and as you are aware we have just crossed the 5 million mark of the number of deaths a worldwide and which is uh extremely extremely unfortunate if you look at the the the pandemic again uh which countries have gone through the third wave and foot as we speak for the six member states have actually experienced the the third wave uh third wave and that is um very uh uh that represents 74 percent and one additional country niger just joined that group of countries that have gone through the third grade seven countries have are now experiencing the food wave that includes algeria benin egypt kenya mauritius and and somali somali and tunisia about your party so if you look at the the trends over there i'll skip the variance this week because there's absolutely no movement in that direction we still have 45 countries reporting the alpha 41 countries reporting the better and for the two countries reporting the data variant so not much have actually occurred there but if you look at the trends over the last um one week that is between the epidemiological period 43 which is the period between 25th and 31st of october and compare that with the period between 18th and 23rd of october we observed the following trends first the number of new cases as we speak today across the continent of as of last week was 32 000 new cases and that represents a slight increase of one percent uh the highest proportion of new cases were from northern africa with 44 percent and then east africa with 17 southern africa 16 uh central africa 14 and west africa 9 if we now look at the new debts a total of 1 277 new debts were reported across the continent compared to 1 300 from the previous week and so this represents a 35 decrease in number of new debts across all 55 member states we'll now look at the four weeks um interval that is uh between the the period of uh the period of maybe very specific here peter between the 4th and the 31st okay of october and we observe a total of 16 average decreased 16 percent average decrease with the original trends as follows two percent average decrease in central africa 29 sorry average increase increase in central africa 29 decrease in southern africa 20 decrease in east africa 8 decrease in northern africa and 6 decrease in western africa so in terms of that we have we recorded over the last four weeks a total average decrease of 16 16 and the trends uh among some major countries include 27 average increase in nigeria 10 average increase in egypt uh a 100 percent decrease in drc 25 decrease in eutopia 21 decrease in south africa and 9 average decrease in kenya in terms of testing as a continent we have conducted a cumulative number of uh about 78 million tests coveted since the pandemic started 2 million cases tests were conducted in the last last week alone and that is very very encouraging and we would like to see understand how that search in number of testing occurred and we will continue to we continue to see a high positivity rate which is around 10.8 percent in terms of capacity africa cdc continues to conduct our trainings on and genomic sequencing as we speak there's a group in dakar senegal at the institute pasteur where we are training a large number of experts on genomic analysis from many countries and i'm actually in senegal i'll be visiting them immediately after this press conference to see how that training is is going on and other trainings have been scheduled to take place in in south africa or are actually taking place in in south africa as we speak uh the africa cdc successfully conducted a one herd conference uh last the last two days very very successful attended by thousands of people so we are very uh pleased with that that amaze this pandemic we continue to carry out very important activities that are unifying the continent in terms of vaccines access a total of 278.7 million doses of vaccines have been delivered on the continent of that number 196.7 million doses have been used and again that represents about 71 of total vaccines that have arrived and use the coverage still remains low coverage in terms of people that have received two doses of vaccines uh is around five point uh 5.8 percent of the total population fully immunized some countries are making good very good progress uh morocco is very very close to 60 percent to a very specific 59.18 of the popular eligible population has been fully vaccinated egypt has fully vaccinated about 8.38 of its population south africa is making a very um aggressive move with about 20 20 percent of the population vaccinated algeria about 10.6 percent vaccinated and tunisia also very encouraging to see the 29 percent uh vaccinated of the population uh very specifically 29.88 of the population vaccinated in terms of uh delivery the other deliveries continue in the past week ever delivered 1.178 million doses of wax jrj vaccines to three countries that included southame and principe where they received 79 000 doses of vaccines nigeria received 624 000 doses of vaccines and total 475 000 doses of vaccines i really want to pose here to continue to applaud the efforts of uh those managing the logistics of this delivery for the other because for nigeria for example there's 624 000 doses of vaccines represents the equivalent of about 1.2 million doses of a double dose vaccine so i think that is very very encouraging news and i think as uh mr masihwa has said before we really are optimistic that our numbers will continue to increase in the month of uh of uh november this month of november really really optimistic that we can begin to hopefully aim for the distribution of about 35 million doses by the end of of november so let me end there for um for now and return it to you uh when to guide us to the question and answer series all right thank you very much that was dr johnny kangasang who is the director of the africa cdc colleagues i want to remind you of the means through which you can send in your questions so the first one would be the whatsapp number plus a two five one nine four five five zero two three one zero alternatively you can come through to us live or utilize the question and answer section right now i don't see any questions that are coming through to us so colleagues please if you have any questions feel free to use any one of those means of communication dr john i wonder if there is any extra advice that you might want to give to uh to colleagues while we wait for questions but as i'm speaking to you we've just received a question and this one is coming from let me see okay no there is it isn't really a question um it's just a notice that our our briefing today will last 45 minutes so if there are any with questions please make sure that you come through now so let me say good morning to dudu ramela who wants to come through life and the duduzile is with the newsroom africa based in south africa good morning sorry i just had to unmute i hope you can hear me good morning muslim thank you i can hear you very well please go ahead thank you good morning doctor and thank you so much for uh the update i do note a decrease in the number of infections and deaths in southern africa south africa has just gone through local government elections and over the past eight weeks it was quite difficult for people to use non-pharmaceutical methods to avoid infection in terms of attending rallies and attending campaigning um i just wanted to know whether the cdc is concerned that post the elections maybe the amount of infections will rise and what your observation has been of the situation during electioneering here at home i do know that some people are worried that we'll go into a harsher lockdown where the country saw the harshest lockdown you know on the continent thank you thank you let me just respond to that very broadly based on our experience in uh dealing this dealing with this pandemic over the last close to two years amazing now that each time we offer the virus a chance to spread it will spread i mean figure this out we're dealing with the values especially the variant the data variant that is all over the place uh with the values that transmit very quickly and if you render the opportunity for the virus to spread a word spread at the same time we have said on this platform that we have to balance between uh livelihoods saving lives and saving livelihoods so if we are not in we are in a mode where we are looking for each country we need to find that balance between where do they situate the measures that will be imprinted for the population versus measures that will save lives i think that is what we have to be playing with now we have said that previously that uh the days where a very severe lockdowns uh where the solution is over we have to begin to balance between uh probably heard and social measures how do we gather information that will enable us uh make informed decisions early on before we go into lockdowns say for example what do i mean by this if i were in south africa now what i would do is that you increase testing right you just say okay elections were conducted people were probably not respecting um the basic uh public health measures but let's increase the amount of testing if you do that uh using the rapid antigen test if you do that you find the hot spots very early and you do something with them rather than wait until those hot spots become wildfires and then we start going into big lockdowns so that is the strategy that we will be advising uh the the continent in the coming uh weeks we'll be launching a vast campaign of uh extensive testing of using the rapid antigen test uh across the continent our target will be that in the next um close to six months we should be able to test about 200 000 people using the rapid antigen test the aim of that is to say that we are now at the the trough of the peaks if you look at what we usually go through the peaks we go through the peaks then it comes down we are the trough and this is a period to do something which is they do something means that we expand testing expand vaccination as much as possible so that we don't need to go to the back to the peak and then when we go to the peak then we create extensive herd damage and extensive economic damage all right so thank you very much john we have a question that's coming from aaron ross and he is with the reuters so aaron says he's following up on an issue that was put forward last week and that is concerning the price at which the african union purchased the modena doses so that's coming from reuters yeah the the prize issue i think can if you don't mind send me a reminder email please and that way we can just send you that answer merely by close of business today so that it's as accurate i did promise last week that we're going to reach out to mr masiwas group who is our lead negotiator in that and want to be sure that we give you the accurate information which we have not obtained not because we don't want to bet i've been on the road i'm in that car now soon it's been a little bit difficult to coordinate but send it to me please my email excuse me you have my email address or you send it to our communication people they will send that to me and promise to give you the answer by close of business all right thank you very much so aaron please do send that email through and if you don't have the email address you can use that whatsapp number that we give you from time to time on this program so we move on now to a question that says the cdc and that is the american cdc recently announced eligibility for boosters for those who take fisa and moderna at six months and for johnson and johnson at two months with africa still in the race to acquire vaccines to reach the initial 40 percent um and then 70 doses does this in any way affect the level of immunity that we are looking to reach on the continent by creating a need for further vaccines and i think that's coming from where data minas and megata is a freelancer yeah i think there let's just go back to the us cdc uh guidelines that you mentioned they were very clear that for those other vaccines that is the messenger rna vaccines that um boosters were recommended for a certain category of people that were immuno suppressed and i think they are that but not for the general population i think that is uh that that is what that guidelines uh stated then with respect to johnson and johnson they recommended um a second dose uh two months later which essentially is saying that uh the johnson and johnson vaccine could have been should have been a double dose not a single dose but here is what we know about the johnson and johnson vaccine the duration of immune response goes way even up to eight months for that vaccine and before he begins to win and if you look at so two things i like to explain here one is the duration of the immunity which is the antibody levels neutralizing antibodies when do they decay and then after the decay what does that mean in terms of people who are exposed to infected if they are sick so just bear with me for one second so if you take a look at the johnson johnson vaccine single dose if you immunize people with that vaccine the the the immunity goes right up to about eight months before it of course all vaccines they win as you expect i mean immune system just dies the way immune system functions but up to about eight months or past six months you still have a high level of neutralizing antibodies for the single dose johnson and johnson and high level means that it gives you way over 70 percent of that that those responses there so there the studies have shown that if you do an additional boosting at two months it actually goes up to more than 90 percent there but a key question from a clinical standpoint is that what does that mean if it goes down slightly after six months or seven months does that mean that if someone is immunized with the johnson and johnson and exposed do you get sick or hospitalized the answer is no we don't see any difference based on the studies that have been published so we at africa cdc are putting together a guideline that we see that the priority is to immunize people first so that everybody gets their double shot as much as possible that johnson and johnson you get their johnson and johnson single dose and then we'll gather more data and then next year we inform uh we use the data to to make a decision so it's like equity you want as many people as possible to be protected than just a few people that have been vaccinated then you keep boosting them up there so that is not equity so i think our position will be informed with the signs that we are seeing will be that yes you can boost food those who are immunosuppressed like the elderly the hiv infected categories but for the general population younger people people who have no co-morbidities we don't have any need for now to be concerned with that given where we are we are 5.5 percent or five point whatever eight percent of the total population immunized so if we start doing boosters of those that five percent we may never ever get to seventy or seven eight sixty to seventy percent all right uh thank you the next question is coming from addis yatachu and adi says how much has been spent on vaccine procurement so far and could you please update us on the outcome of your communication with the european union authorities on the latter's decision not to recognize vaccine certificates from africa and addis is with anadolu news agency uh the vaccine for questions with a pricing please just um contact the other coordination uh office that is mr masihua's office i mean we don't deal with pricing at all it's not like we are we don't want to share the information i just don't have the accurate information to give you uh daddy with the negotiations with the african bank colleagues so please reach out to them uh concerning the the second part of the question that deals with um the as you know has is evolving so let me take it into two you remember the uk government initially said that we are not recognizing vaccinations in africa i think that's that they have since walked back from that situation if you if you recall so i think and we issued a statement a strong statement we met with the minister of africa and we have since um we've seen that they have walked back from that situation the european of course many countries if you recall had started recognizing large number of countries very early on actually about 19 of them were saying we recognized that but we have not seen a common position as the eu but we know that individual countries are recognizing the vaccines that um we use uh in africa to be very specific the astrazeneca commission all right thank you let's go to sarah jerving who is with devex and sarah says do you have any more specifics on either the moderna or bayern tech manufacturing facilities in african nations uh we don't have any specifics i i will be in the next the reason we are making this uh course short is that from here i'm heading to the pastor institute of dhaka and to i'm actually in senegal i'll be heading to the past ten to look at their facilities and also look at them visit the production site the building the physical building that the production will happen and we are very pleased with the news last week in rwanda but we now we know that and i have a call with the bound tech group next week we know that the target is to start make sure everything is in place and start the production by by mid next year so that's what we know you will in the coming days be invited to join an africa cdc meeting a com conference or summit or meeting that will happen at the end of this month where we will be discussing uh regulatory issues on the continent with respect to if these countries start producing the vaccines how do we organize ourselves and for a regulatory as part of the armor the african medicine agency that you know that has been rectified as a treaty so how do we work together with au nepa the cfta that is the continental free trade area as well as um as amma and africa cdc to make sure that we have a regulatory framework in place that will enable us to uh stamp our approval on those vaccines once they are produced in senegal dhaka and other places all right thank you john judith ocalo who is with the kenya broadcasting corporation that's akolo uh not of color morning judith and judith says that the decrease in infections has made people relax and perhaps only wear masks for the simple reason that they're going into urban areas and they fear being arrested by the police for not wearing masks so she says my question is are we setting ourselves up for another onslaught of the infections and also what happens with the momentum to establish a vaccine manufacturing centers in africa if the public focus is on a reduction in infections and deaths and hence will this not um lead to the belief that this is the end through the coveted 19 pandemic among the public no jude that's a very good question i i i know you are operating or reporting from kenya and kenya has gone through the four ways and you know that it usually takes between two months to three months between waves so uh if you are down what are called uh um just with a crude analogy if you are at the bottom of the valley now which many countries are now at the bottom of the valley expect that in two to three months you will come back up okay just because of the reasons you stated uh judith because uh people are more relaxed uh they don't see people dying they assume that they lower their guts and because of that the virus spreads quickly that's why this is the moment to do two key things and this is my strong appeal to countries do the testing surveillance at this point so that you can pick the hot spots very early on and squash them if you look at the maps of this the the peaks and the troughs is it usually goes flat for a while and then when it comes up it comes up very quickly okay it means that there is spots of hot spots going on and nobody knew about it and the only way to find those hospitals is to expand the rapid test at a community level and find those hot spots do something with it i think that is one that way we avoid locking down the the economies there second is vaccination the time people who have not been vaccinated and there are vaccines out there you go out and get vaccines so that when the food wave or the feed wave arrives your your immune system is um we don't vaccinate today and expect to be protected tomorrow i mean these vaccines usually take a few weeks or to actually give you the right protection so i think this is the right time appeal to countries is that expand your vaccination now that we are experiencing the lower transmissions expand your testing now so that we can completely blunt the arrival of the the quality the food wave or the feed wave and with respect to vaccine manufacturing i'm very encouraged that we and we can give you an update of this subsequently through the african vaccine partnership for african vaccine manufacturing pam they are now about 15 countries that have expressed an interest in vaccine manufacturing okay and there's um really a lot of countries there and some leading countries south africa rwanda uh um at senegal and you also have kenya just joined and so we are very encouraged with that but what we are saying is that let's do that in a coordinated fashion let's do that in an ecosystem so that everybody understands where in the ecosystem of vaccine manufacturing we want to see it let's also do that with and shape the market so that we know that if you produce vaccines they will be buy a market for the vaccines there so we are very encouraged it's a good problem to have a good problem that many countries want to manufacture vaccines and it would have been a terrible problem if no country in africa was interested in vaccine manufacturing all right thank you for that lucia blanco from the international spanish news agency says my question is about the ebola outbreak in the drc is there any updates or new information that you have and also what are the lessons that have been learned from previous experiences and are being implemented now and then finally she asks is the outbreak under control at the moment so as of this week we have uh less than 10 cases in that country but unfortunately with a very high uh mortality uh as usual the case fatality rate for ebola is is very high and um the beauty with that this outbreak is that most people in that region have been vaccinated okay from previous outbreaks okay so they're what we call ring vaccinations so we believe that the reason we have not seen an escalation is that of many people had already been vaccinated previously remember last year we were in that region for about two years so i think we continue to keep our fingers crossed that the the the pandemic the outbreak uh stays very limited so we're up we are optimistic we have people in the theater of respond uh within three days we're able to put people in the theater of that response and since we have uh responders in in congo already so that's all we we know for now so in terms of previous experience yes the vaccines are out there cooperation with the community has been critical that's why many people were able to be vaccinated and continue to be vaccinated now by the world organization thank you we go now to gemma who is writing from media hack and the gemma says does the africa cdc know whether eritrea will start vaccinating against covid19 and if not what is the reason for not vaccinating uh eritrea we continue to engage with eritrea and but i remain optimistic and this is a very uh an honest answer you remember just a few months ago there were three countries that we i was we told you we're going to engage with them it was tanzania burundi and eritrea i went to tanzania and met with the head of state and the situation has since changed burundi we've engaged with them and they are now buying vaccines through avad and they also have received vaccines from from kovacs so i mean we have one more to go and we are not giving up until all of africa is uh engaged in this uh fight against uh kobet 19. if it means going to eritrea to meet with the highest leadership we will go there and meet with the highest leadership because there is no way that uh we are going to get rid of kovit across the continent without engaging all countries and without all countries taking their own responsibility to vaccinate to up to 70 of the population okay let's go back to judith arcolo who is with the kenya broadcasting corporation and she has a follow-up question she says now that dr karina's song says that the immunosuppressed people and those that are elderly may need a booster jab what happens to those that got their first shot in may for instance in kenya would they need to get the booster shot in january for example if you got your first shot in in may then uh you don't need to wait until if i understand the question right you don't need to wait until january to get your second i mean shot i think usually it's about four weeks six weeks to to eight weeks in trouble between the first shot and the the second uh shot to complete the the dosing them so i think there's um they we should not uh confuse booster which is the third dose boosting versus a second dose which is just the process of full immunization i think full immunization for vaccines that are two doses is i don't call that a booster it does a complete immunization a booster a third dose booster will be where you receive your two doses of vaccines within a period of an interval of six weeks and then after six months or eight months uh you are eligible to take a a vaccine so i think that is um what uh it is so if the people have received their first dose of any type of vaccine with the exception of johnson and johnson because it's a single dose vaccine then they should try to respect the interval which usually is between uh four weeks to six weeks to eight weeks depending on the vaccine so that they can get their second dose of the vaccine i don't know if i answer your question in fact judith has just come through again to say she was asking about the booster dose i.e the third dose oh they take those of course uh conservatively and there's really no exact data to say that you should do it at six months or you should do it at eight months but i would say that based on level between six months to eight months you should get that for those who are immuno compromised and the elderly in africa please i just want this to be very clear that it doesn't go on the record that i i'm recommending booster for everybody absolutely not the case for now and we'll be issuing guidelines into that effect all right thank you um just for the in information of those who are asking for the whatsapp number let me i repeat it again and it is a plus two five one nine four five five zero two three one zero plus two five one nine four five five zero two three one zero i believe we have another question that's coming in from sarah jerving i think this is a follow-up question and she says how are communities responding to the drc ebola response have you seen any resistance with any of your response efforts and do you know what percentage of people in that area are vaccinated and finally how long does the vaccination protection last and that is in regards to ebola yeah very good question so if a we have not seen any resistance in that uh that area with respect to um ebola uh response efforts remember this is an origin that is already from a point of view of sociology and anthropology already aware of ebola and the efforts that go in there so it's not this is nothing new to them our community trust has been established over the last couple of outbreaks that we have been in that region uh in terms of percentage vaccination i truly don't know the exact number but that is a very good question that i would like to let my team uh investigate him in the field investigate and we can take up that that question uh offline and provide you with answers as well as the the duration of immunity i know that uh unlike the vaccines for for for kobe uh the that the vaccines for ebola had really have a long lasting immunity but how long i really don't know but it would be um good to go back and remember these vaccines just came online just about three three years ago so and many use where they came online in west africa and they use in dlc fairly in the last two or three years so we still have to see over long periods of time if the immunity how long the immunity stays and that will based on prospective studies to find that out so i think no one can actually give a specific answer with that but that is truly an area of um active investigation all right thank you john we have a question that's coming in from andrew meldrum uh who is with associated press he has a number so first he says what is the outlook for vaccinations by the end of this year secondly are vaccine doses arriving and being administered at a rate that africa could achieve a vaccination rate of 10 percent by the end of this year so those are the two questions coming from andrew yeah andrew very good question i think there our projection as mr masiwa will tell you is to confirm is that uh we are hoping that by the end of the year avat let me start with avat can distribute up to about 35 million doses cumulatively so i think we are at probably around 12 million and we expect to see uh put our distribution scale up based on the contracts to get to the 35 million and we are also hopeful that kovacs uh deliveries will also come in so that the coverts and other deliveries add up to that enable the countries to get to the right a percentage by the end of the year uh all of us our hope and wish is that by the end of the year uh at least 40 of the population would have been vaccinated but again remember where we are we have five percent today or five point five percent so there is enough heaters to get there uh vaccines that are coming in country uh being used uh uh yes uh the rate of administration values i mean africa is not a country so you have to unpack them and see some of those countries that are listed here the likes of morocco rwanda rwanda has administered 25 of his vaccines of the eligible population and their target is to get to 40 percent and because of that kind of a remarkable progress we are making we just issued a statement i think two days ago making rwanda and morocco two of our centers of excellence for uh vaccination one what does that mean it means that we'll be bringing in people to from different countries to those kind of centers in morocco it will be the pastor institute in casablanca and in rwanda it will be the um the biomedical the rwanda biomedical center because of the speed the organization and the logistics that they have put in place i think they offered an opportunity for learning so that our other countries can learn how to vaccinate our scale so i think the point i'm making is that it's not a uniform statement that i can make there are countries that are on the the very fast track accelerated part way to get into 70 percent there are countries that are in the middle you see that south africa is around 20 percent and we continue to see the numbers increase and then you are on the lower side other countries that are really still struggling to to come up to to speed so uh it's a question of balancing our we at africa cdc through the partnership with the mastercard foundation will be scaling up uh the support to countries in november end of november about 20 countries will be in morocco as part of the center there is the center of excellence approach that we're adopting to learn their experience and

",this is richard wolff from democracy at work with another wolf response that i'd like to call mandate madness i want to talk about the mandates we have these days particularly around vaccination and all of the struggles and upset around the question of of mandates so bear with me i'm going to approach it through three topics why i think resisting mandates is a good thing in many cases number two what if the science is about the vaccine and the disease that we should be clear about when thinking about mandates and then finally where we ought to be doing mandates a lot more than in the realm of vaccines so let's start with why i think resisting mandates is a good thing well first of all it's justified by history the government telling us what to do like the pharmaceutical companies the drug companies telling us what to do what to make everyone suspicious they haven't been telling us the truth for a very long time the pharmaceutical companies are famous for making their decisions like most capitalist corporations in order to make money to make profits they tell us what's good about the drugs they want us to take and they're not so good about telling us about the bad parts which is what every corporation does when it advertises tell you about whatever's good in the product they're selling and bury hide deny the bad that's not a good thing about our economic system but it is the way it is and the pharmaceuticals and the government have been major tellers of let's be polite half truths so of course we should be very dubious about being mandated to do something from these people number two they've done a stunningly bad job on this covered disaster so they're not in a good position to be mandating much let's be clear the united states has four and a half percent of the population of this planet that's what our 330 million fellow americans add up to four and a half percent of the world's people but this country has now suffered 20 nearly 20 percent of the deaths from covid that's not a good performance that's an awful performance and the government and the pharmaceuticals and the health professions have lots of responsibility for this failure not only them but they're not in a big position to get up all in our face about mandates you should do this and you should do that we're seeing a lot of resistance from varieties of unions firefighters and police personnel airline personnel all kinds of working-class people who don't want to be mandated to take a vaccine many of them the majority of them either already are vaccinated or planned to be and have no opposition to a vaccine what they're opposed to is the mandate they didn't fight for the last 150 years to get labor laws and labor regulations that don't allow employer to mandate how much you get paid and mandate what the job conditions are no no no you have to work that out with the workers through their union that's a large part of why they form unions and they're not allowed about to let all that be taken away under the name of a health emergency that's not too very clever is it kind of a thin justification to take away what labor fought hard to get there was no need for mayor de blasio in new york and other officials to dictate to mandate get together with the unions and work out a plan that will allow people to get vaccinated and so forth and so on don't be dictating it's not seemly it's not appropriate and it's not going to be tolerated which is why so many people are quitting their jobs these days striking against employers who are mandating all kinds of stuff there's a resistance movement going on in the united states and it also includes resistance to mandates about a vaccine let me turn next to the science which is important there was a time on and off over the last year and a half when it was thought by health professionals that if you were vaccinated you wouldn't transmit the disease whereas if you were unvaccinated you would both get it more quickly and transmit it much more under those circumstances if that were the true science i could understand a mandate i could be suspicious wouldn't want it to be the first thing we do but i could see it as a fallback and i use a metaphor there it's a little bit like having cars which we all do going places which that with them which we all do and therefore entering and leaving intersections where the roads meet and we have a mandate there a little light above the intersection when it's green you can drive and when it's red you have to stop and if you don't observe the mandate to stop when it's red there'll be a policeman or woman who will arrest you or give you a ticket you all know that's a mandate we all understand we accept that our freedom to drive wherever i want what i want has to be curtailed for the benefit of all of us that we don't kill ourselves and each other in car crashes that is a scientifically developed understanding so we accept the mandate there is now considerable science from mr biden's office in the presidency that if you have the vaccine you do not get as sick which is why people like me and most others now do it we don't get as sick but it isn't an avoidance of transmission turns out with a vaccine if the science is now correct you can transmit just like you can if you're not vaccinated and get the disease well if we're not transmitting it then we can't use an argument to mandate people get it on the grounds that they're going to infect others because getting the vaccine doesn't stop that from happening so that science is part of the story is the mandate justified the way a traffic light is or is it not because the science doesn't mean that if you're not vaccinated you're a threat to other people that's an important question we should be discussing it but we should not be screaming at the people who object to a mandate when the science as well as that history i just went to puts a lot of reason behind it finally why are we focused so much on mandating this vaccine given the science and given the history there are other things we ought to mandate here's one we ought to mandate that we have enough hospitals in this country to handle the pandemics that we have had periodically in our history we should never have allowed those hospitals to go out of business often a profit driven decision by a hospital corporation we shouldn't have allowed capitalism to deprive us of the medical facilities we need that would be a mandate that the people would support sustaining hospitals here's another one give everybody a health insurance mandate that why don't you we do a very selective job of mandating and given who's doing it and given the history and given the science we are well within a very rational position to be dubious and question and resist the mandate madness around us,False,en,True
